One of the most prominent objectives of the project is to highlight 
several technical and analytical aspects that include preparing 
it from scratch. 
Based on the assumption: Why was the application designed? 
Issues that existed previously before the application design and 
suggested solutions that were included within the application . 
Then analyze the requirements and divide them into functional and 
 non-functional depending on several things. 
A brief overview of the company producing this application (Google) 
and the methodology by which the application was designed was 
mentioned. 
Based on the analytical aspect, there must be several models on which 
 the application is based, to know many of them direct stakeholders 
 and their roles, and each role represents a process belonging to a 
specific database and the chronology of certain operations such as 
seeing maps and others. 
At the end of the project, the team gained experience in technical 
content analysis and software analysis from the roots.
